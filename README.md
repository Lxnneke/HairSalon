Hair Salon Website Recreation
============================
So, welcome to this recreation of a hair salon website for the 100 devs homework (specifically class 10).


### Update 1:
I want to do this a little differently than usual, so here is what I want to do! 
- I want to update the README file regularly, after every update.
- I want to start from phone and build out from there, hopefully making it 100% responsive.

I hope you'll be willing to watch along with me and see how I'll manage! 

For now, this is what I did: 
> Set up the photos and files. No text or styles added yet, just the bare basics to get started.


### Update 2: 
I have finished setting up all the text in the HTML (not all the classes yet though!) and set up the basics for CSS. I added a few photos I missed, the font link and the fontawesome links!

My next step: 
> Start with the phone version for the first time. See how that works for me!

### Update 3: 
So, I have started on my phone version. I will admit, it's more difficult than I anticipated. I am struggling with getting the right measurements etc, especially with just float. But we are getting there (hopefully)

### Update 4: 
Did not have a great work day, so I got started on the nav bar for the laptop view. Made sure it still worked on phone view as well, and started on the main section of the website!

### Update 5: 

Got a lil bit further with the main section of the webpage! I am just looking forward to the weekend so I can actually spend some time finishing it up asap!
